### Requirements

-- NPM at 6.13.2

-- npm install --save-dev cross-env (needed to set cross-env executables. Required to run it)

-- The configurations for this project (such as: eslint, packages, babel, webpack, etc.) have been inherited from a similar project to speed up developmenet. Hence, unused packages do exists but I have worked to eliminate most but some still remains.

--The 'engine/` dir is an external directory that handles encoding and processing in this project.

--The active Trello profile: https://trello.com/b/eZObcmYb/project-plans
